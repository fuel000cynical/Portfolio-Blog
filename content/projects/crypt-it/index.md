### How We Built It ?
Using node.js, mongoDB, html, css, and js, we built a webapp. This allowed us to make a secure way for participants to login, access the questions, and get their answers checked.

### Fun Fact
Our competition was supposed to start on 2nd July, but a major setback occoured. The website that our club juniors had built got hacked very soon. So, me and my friend Vandit Kad rebuilt the whole website in a single night and the competition started smoothly on 3rd July.
