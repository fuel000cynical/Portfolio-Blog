## 📺 CtrlTube – We Manipulated YouTube.

CtrlTube is a Chrome extension that transforms YouTube into your personal learning assistant. No more distractions — just pure, focused, educational content.

We built CtrlTube in under 36 hours at [KT HACK 2025](https://kthack-2025.devpost.com/), and it went on to win the **Best Educational Hack award 🏆**.

## 🎓 What if YouTube actually helped you study?
CtrlTube mutes distractions, highlights educational videos, and keeps your focus in check — all without leaving the platform.
<br>
<br>

## 🧠 Why We Built CtrlTube
YouTube is the world's biggest classroom — but it's also the world's biggest distraction engine. We wanted to fix that.

#### CtrlTube is for:

- Students who rely on YouTube for learning
- Self-learners tired of getting pulled into rabbit holes
- Anyone who wants focus-first content consumption

<br>

## Future Plans
We want to release CTRLTube as an extension on chrome to all everyone to manage their time better and improve the brain food they have.

## 💬 Final Thoughts
CtrlTube was more than a hack — it was a statement. A reminder that tools don’t need to be complex to be impactful. Sometimes, the best innovations are the ones that remove distractions rather than add features.
